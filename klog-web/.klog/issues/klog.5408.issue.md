this is not a critical issue, but it would be nice to be able to use my phone to control the klog, especially when little or no text input is required. For example, to start work, log that bugs have been fixed, and stop work. I imagine using the phone like an extra set of buttons, like a remote control for the code. It could also be used to issue git commands, or any commands actually.
