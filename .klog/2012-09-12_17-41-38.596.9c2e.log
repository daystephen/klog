Title: add attachments to issues

it should be possible to add attachments to issues. it should be discouraged to add large attachments, as they will bloat the git repo. I imagine this being implemented rather like attachments in email documents. it should be possible to reference the attachments from other klogs and form the comments. this will require the attachment to be addressable via the klog uid and it's own index.
