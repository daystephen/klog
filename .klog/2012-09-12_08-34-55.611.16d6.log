Title: confirmation for delete
Added: 2012-09-12_08-34-55.611

it is too easy to delete an issue - and although they are tracked in theory via git - a confirmation would be nice. Probably enough to have default answer of Y - just meaning you must double tap enter, and with some details about the bug - like title etc... first.
