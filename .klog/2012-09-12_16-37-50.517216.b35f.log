Title: create server interface

this can be done in both php, and javascript. I doubt I will do it in perl, but it could be done. the underlying api should remain the same, as in the web-interface should be cosmetic only, abstracting away both the interface, and the underlying api calls, which will be simple command line commande. the job of the web server, is to interpret the gui commands, and execute appropriate klog commands, passing back the output to the user.
