Title: port to nodejs and php
Added: 2012-09-12_16-23-03.680
Status: open

although perl is quite prevelant on development machines, php is the dominant language of web-servers, and javasript is up and coming on servers, and is prevelant on all platforms. It makes a lot of sense for all this to work as a nodejs project, installable through npm. It also makes a lot of sense to work as a php based service, served by apache.
