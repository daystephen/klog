Title: include klog binary in the .klog directory
Added: 2012-09-12_16-33-17.090

the binary is so small, it makes sense to deliver it along with the source code. This will ensure ther eare no compatibilty issues whilst still less than version 1 and there are many changes to the interface. It is probably better in the long run, to simply include a readme file in the .klog directory explaining where to get the software to understand the klog files.
