$ # business as usual</textarea><h3>Issue tracking</h3><p>files are stored as plain text files, witha  filename based on the exact time the issue was raised (millisecond precision) and the firstbits of a hash generated from the authors email address. these firstbits become the UID of the issue, preventing colision with other issues being raised by other developers at the same time.</p><p>by keeping all the issues with the git repo, it becomes a great offline tool for managing a project. any developer who has the repo, also has the tools needed to track progress, pick a task to work on, and read the rationale behind chages to the code. this feature is also great for archiving projects, with the confidence that all the related discussion and material is all in one place!</p><h3>Time management (work log)</h3><p>one issue that keeps coming up for me personally, is how to effectively track work activity, and time spent on a project. after trying out several solutions, from online log files, spreadsheets, and time tracking software, I ended up reverting to plain old time-stamped log files. after programming a hotkey to insert the date I would just write down when I started working, then each thing I did as a brief description line, and when I finished. this would constitute a `block` of work, and I would then calculate the time spent on each block. this system has been working great for me, but I could not help feeling it could be much better.</p><p>my current best idea, is to try to link the process of tracking issues, making commits, and managing time, as they are all very much integral to the work process. when I am working on a bug, I want that work to be related to a `block` that can be identified how long, and when it took place, and also the code and comments relating to the work. filling the gap here is what klog is all about.</p><div id="foot"><p class="silver"><i>this project is very much in it's early stages and should be considered a development project, not yet fit for production. watch out for version 1.0.0!</i></p></div></div><script type="text/javascript">
