## Have you got klogs on?

klog - A simple distributed issue tracking system.

## About

klog is an intentionally simple system which allows bugs to be stored
inside projects, and merged in along with all other changes in exactly the
way that a user of a distributed revision control system would expect.

currently, klog is implemented as a node.js project, and is installable
via the node package manager...

    $ [sudo] npm install klog -g

(global flag recommended so the `klog` command is immediately available!)
